			So, this is my first blog post! I honestly don't have a whole ton to say, as I've already run pretty much everything down in my About Me on the landing page.
			This is honestly nothing more than a simple test to make sure my site is working and all, which it seems to be for the most part. I'm missing a lot of links
			and similar things at the moment but I intend to add them soon enough. You can visit my GitHub and YouTube at the moment and that's about it. I'll
			be primarily posting things related to Vulkan and C* (my compiler) for a while but might also dabble in some other things if I find them interesting. Otherwise,
			that's all I've really got to say. Glad to have started this for myself!
